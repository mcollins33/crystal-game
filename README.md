# crystal-game

This game was made using html, css, bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery.  I am pleased to say that I was able to get this game to work exactly the way I wanted it to.  

The most challenging part of this game was to get it to determine a win/loss and reset.  I wanted to use a for loop and boolean to loop through the game like I did in Hangman, but I had nothing to loop through.  I tried to use a random number, but it ended up running code that should not have been run.  I started creating functions using JQuery.  This was something I was unable to do in Hangman.  I used the funcitons to call other functions which enabled me to determine a win/loss and reset the variables in the game.  I still could not get the game to start over until I started the game with a function and created a complete loop.
